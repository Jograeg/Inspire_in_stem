<h3> Story Of My Life</h3>
    <p> My name is james and I hate everything. I am a very bad person and I like drinking blood. I come out of the shadows at night and hunt so that 
        I can sustain myself. Please stay indoors at night or you will become a meal for me and my pack. Yours faithfully ME......
    </p>
<h3>Story part 2</h3>
    <p>I dont know what I was typing so please forgive me. I am even worse than that you will die even if you lock yourselves in your houses 
        I will find a way in and you will die.
